# Tushop Coding Assignment

This repo contains problems for the Tushop coding assignment. The solutions for the problems are in index.js files of the `probleml` and `problem2` repositories respectively.
The screen recording for the execution of this code is on the link here: https://www.loom.com/share/4dce2317135b4be78d0479867155bfc1

## Running tests

To run tests, first install the requirements:

```bash
npm install
```

Then run the jest command at the root of the project directory:

```bash
node_modules/.bin/jest
```

## Run individual files

Ensure to UNCOMMENT the `driver` code in the `index.js` files, then run the following:

```bash
node problem1/index.js
```

```bash
node problem2/index.js
```

You can look at the `*.output.txt` file in each individual directory to ascertain the results.
